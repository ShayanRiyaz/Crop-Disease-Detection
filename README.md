# Crop Disease Detection App
For this project I will be creating a plant disease detection system using Tensorflow 2.0.0.

The purpose of this project is to be able to use local crop databases across the globe from any country and use it to create their own detection system. The output of the project is an android app.


***Libraries Used***
- Tensorflow
- Tensorflow hub
- Keras

The used dataset is available on kaggle.

In the future I will be creating an app using flutter
